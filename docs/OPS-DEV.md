# Running the Qnero dev chain

The chain lives in `chain/`, a git subtree of Quantus-Network/chain at
`f1176ce` (v1.0.1). It is its own Cargo workspace with its own toolchain and
lock file; the Qnero root workspace excludes it, and the two meet only through
the path dependencies `chain/Cargo.toml` declares on `../crates/*`.

Every command below is prefixed with `nice -n 19`. The circuit generation and
the proving tests are CPU and memory heavy, and a chain build at `-j 4` will
occupy a machine for the better part of an hour.

## Building

```
cd chain
LIBCLANG_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-18/lib nice -n 19 cargo build -j 4 --release -p quantus-node
```

The node binary lands at `chain/target/release/quantus-node`.

`LIBCLANG_PATH` is not optional on Linux. `librocksdb-sys` runs bindgen, whose
`clang-sys` build script panics with "couldn't find any valid shared libraries
matching: ['libclang.so', 'libclang-*.so']" when it cannot locate one.
`chain/.cargo/config.toml` sets the variable only on macOS, where Homebrew puts
it somewhere non-standard; on a Debian-family box point it at whichever
`/usr/lib/llvm-*/lib` holds `libclang.so`, and install `libclang-dev` if none
does.

`pallet-shielded`'s build script generates the circuit artifact set before the
pallet compiles, which is where the first minute goes and where most of the
memory goes. Two sizing knobs override the defaults, and both are declared
`cargo:rerun-if-env-changed` so a change to either rebuilds the pallet:

```
QNERO_NUM_LEAF_PROOFS=2 QNERO_NUM_PRIVATE_BATCH_PROOFS=2 cargo build ...
```

Small dimensions are for fixtures and local iteration. A node built with them
settles only proofs built with them.

### One lock pin the fork needs

`chain/Cargo.lock` pins `kem` at `0.3.0-pre.0`:

```
cargo update -p kem --precise 0.3.0-pre.0
```

That is the version `ml-kem 0.2.1` needs, which `clatter` needs, which the
post-quantum Noise transport needs. The requirement is written `^0.3.0-pre.0`,
which the released `0.3.0` also satisfies, so anything that pulls a second
`ml-kem` into the graph lets Cargo pick `0.3.0` and `ml-kem 0.2.1` then fails to
compile against an API it was never written for. Nothing in the Qnero crates
pulls one any more, so the pin is defensive; it is here because the symptom is
eighteen type errors in a crate nobody in this repository calls.

## Tests

```
cd chain
SKIP_WASM_BUILD=1 nice -n 19 cargo test -j 4 -p pallet-shielded --release
nice -n 19 cargo clippy -j 4 -p pallet-shielded --all-targets
```

`--release` is not optional for this crate's tests: several build a real
private-batch proof, and proving in a debug build takes minutes per proof.
`SKIP_WASM_BUILD=1` skips the runtime wasm blob, which the pallet tests do not
need.

Rayon is deliberately off in this crate's dev-dependencies, so a test run proves
single threaded and cannot saturate the machine. The proofs are memoized across
tests and guarded by a mutex, so one proving runs at a time whatever the test
harness's thread count is.

The public-batch settlement path is covered by its algebra and by its verifier
loading, and not by a proof: proving a public batch at the chain default of 53
inner proofs needs 53 private-batch proofs first. To exercise it end to end,
rebuild small:

```
QNERO_NUM_LEAF_PROOFS=2 QNERO_NUM_PRIVATE_BATCH_PROOFS=2 \
  SKIP_WASM_BUILD=1 nice -n 19 cargo test -j 4 -p pallet-shielded --release
```

## Running a dev chain

```
cd chain
nice -n 19 ./target/release/quantus-node --dev --tmp
```

`--tmp` keeps the chain state in a temporary directory, so a rerun starts from
genesis. Without it, use `purge-chain --dev` between runs. The RPC endpoint is
the Substrate default, `http://127.0.0.1:9944`.

## Smoke checks

Blocks are produced:

```
curl -s -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"chain_getHeader","params":[]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:9944
```

The header carries `zkTreeRoot` beside `stateRoot` and `extrinsicsRoot`. That
field is the whole anchoring chain: a spend proof's public `block_hash` commits
to this header, the header carries the tree root, and each input note's Merkle
path reaches that root.

The commitment tree's own view, which should agree with the header:

```
curl -s -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"zkTree_getState","params":[]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:9944
```

A leaf appended in block N becomes provable only after that block's
`on_finalize`, so `zkTree_getMerkleProof` on a leaf from the current block
returns an error. That is a property a wallet has to
respect: a note cannot be minted and spent in the same block.

The shielded pallet is in the runtime:

```
curl -s -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"state_getMetadata","params":[]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:9944 > /tmp/metadata.json
```

Decoding that blob needs a SCALE decoder. The cheap check without one is that
the hex contains the pallet name and its call names, which the smoke run below
used.

## The M4 smoke run, 2026-09-12

Recorded so a rerun has something to compare against. Development workstation,
20 cores, WSL2.

Build:

```
cd chain
LIBCLANG_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-18/lib nice -n 19 cargo build -j 4 --release -p quantus-node
```

14 minutes 11 seconds of wall clock with a warm dependency cache, of which 41
seconds was `pallet-shielded`'s build script generating the circuit artifact
set. A cold cache is longer: the earlier passes of this same build spent about
an hour reaching the runtime, and `librocksdb-sys` alone compiles hundreds of
C++ objects. The binary is 80 MB at
`chain/target/release/quantus-node`.

Run:

```
nice -n 19 ./target/release/quantus-node --dev --tmp
```

Blocks from the first second: `Imported #1` two seconds after genesis, height
50 shortly after. What the smoke run checked:

- `chain_getHeader` carries `zkTreeRoot` beside `stateRoot` and
  `extrinsicsRoot`, and it equals the root `zkTree_getState` reports
  (`0x6f1d7291c5bb3948d26006250226bc9f7a09f2ca66a4b11f1cf0fc4c8ebe0575` at
  height 50, tree depth 3, 55 leaves). Those leaves are the wormhole's: the
  genesis endowments it records at block 1 and a mining-reward leaf per block.
  The pool is empty until someone shields.
- `zkTree_getMerkleProof(0)` returns a proof whose `leaf_hash` and `leaf_data`
  are the same 32 bytes, which is the fork's leaf rule showing through the RPC.
- `state_getMetadata` carries the pallet: `Shielded`, its three calls
  (`submit_private_batch`, `submit_public_batch`, `shield`), its storage
  (`UsedNullifiers`, `Ciphertexts`, `LeafBlocks`, `EntryCount`, `PoolValue`),
  its constants (`BlockHashWindow`, `MinLeafFee`, `FeeBurnRate`,
  `MaxCiphertextBytes`), its events and the `ShieldedOutput` type.
- `state_getRuntimeVersion` reports `quantus-runtime` spec 152, transaction
  version 6. `transaction_version` is genuinely unchanged, because the signed
  extrinsic encoding did not move. `spec_version` is a different matter and the
  number was left alone for a different reason: upstream's release workflow owns
  that field (`runtime/src/lib.rs` says so), and a feature branch that bumps it
  fights the release tooling.

  **This is an open issue.** The runtime did change:
  it carries a new pallet and a `pallet-zk-tree` whose `Leaves` storage went
  from a typed `ZkLeaf` to a raw `Hash256`, with no migration (see
  `docs/CIRCUIT.md` section 4). Two runtimes with different metadata and an
  incompatible storage layout now answer the same `quantus-runtime` 152, which
  is the one thing the version triple exists to prevent: a node cannot tell them
  apart, and `set_code` refuses an upgrade whose `spec_version` did not
  increase. Before the fork runs anything but a throwaway `--dev` chain it needs
  its own identity, `spec_name = "qnero-runtime"` or a distinct `spec_version`.
  Nothing here is affected while every chain is genesis fresh.

## The review fix pass, 2026-09-12

Same workstation. The pallet and the runtime changed, so the node was rebuilt
and re-smoked.

```
cd chain
LIBCLANG_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-18/lib nice -n 19 cargo build -j 4 --release -p quantus-node
```

3 minutes 17 seconds of wall clock against the warm tree from the first pass,
of which 54 seconds was the circuit artifact set regenerating: the build script
reruns whenever the pallet's sources change. The binary is 80 MB at
`chain/target/release/quantus-node`.

`--dev --tmp` again, stopped after about two minutes at height 17. Blocks from
the first second, `Imported #1` through `#17`. What this run checked:

- `chain_getHeader`'s `zkTreeRoot` equals the root `zkTree_getState` reports
  (`0x900fc49126275fe988cd7d95a29da563adb251b45ae6b3c2e39a7a933bfc4077` at
  height 8, tree depth 2, 13 leaves, all of them the wormhole's).
- `zkTree_getMerkleProof(0)` returns a proof whose `leaf_hash` and `leaf_data`
  are the same 32 bytes.
- `state_getMetadata` carries `Shielded` with its three calls, its five storage
  items, its errors including `FeeBelowMinimum` and `CiphertextDigestMismatch`,
  and its six constants: `MintingAccount`, `BlockHashWindow`, `MinLeafFee`,
  `CiphertextBytesPerFeeQuantum` (new in this pass, the per-byte half of the fee
  floor), `FeeBurnRate` and `MaxCiphertextBytes`.
- `state_getRuntimeVersion` still reports `quantus-runtime` spec 152,
  transaction version 6. The runtime identity issue above is unchanged and still
  open: this pass added a pallet constant, which is another metadata change
  behind the same version number.
